= VM Connector Dynamic Routing Example - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::vm/vm-dynamic-routing.adoc

You can use expressions to have a generic flow that sends messages to different queues depending on certain conditions. For instance, you can make xref:vm-publish-listen.adoc[the publish and listen example] more interesting by also using an expression in the `queueName` attribute.

Suppose that the JSON object that you get through the HTTP connector includes a destination object that maps directly to the name of the queue to which you need to write. You can do the following:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="publish">
    <http:listener path="/json-here" allowedMethods="POST" config-ref="httpListener" />
    <vm:publish queueName="#[payload.destination]">
        <vm:content>#[payload.body]</vm:content>
    </vm:publish>
    <logger/>
</flow>
----
