[node-behavior]
== Receiving Messages in Cluster Mode

The default behavior of the Receive Messages input source is to receive messages on all nodes when running in cluster mode. To have the app receive messages on the primary node only:

. In Studio, select the `Receive Messages` input source for your flow.
. On the *Advanced* sub-tab of the *Receive messages* tab, select the *Primary node only* checkbox.

The multi-node cluster behavior depends on the selected SQS queue type. When using the Standard queue, SQS guarantees that a message is delivered at least once. However, duplicate messages can be introduced in the queue. You can use a FIFO queue to ensure that a message is delivered only once and that it remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it.

For more information about queue types, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/standard-queues.html[AWS SQS Stanard Queues] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html[AWS SQS FIFO Queues].

== Creating the FIFO Queue

FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues deliver messages in the order in which they are sent.

To create the FIFO queue, use the *Create queue* operation in the connector, and set the *FifoQueue* and *ContentBasedDeduplication* field values to true.

End the *queue name* value with the `.fifo` extension: for example, `MyTestFIFOQueue.fifo`.

While creating the FIFO queues, choose either of the two regions that Amazon supports:

* US_EAST_2 (US East Ohio)
* US_WEST_2 (US West Oregon)

When using Amazon SQS Connector to send messages to the FIFO queue, use the same queue URL and region name that you used when creating the FIFO queue. You must also provide a value for the attribute `message group id` in the connector configuration while sending messages.
