= Use Studio to Configure Veeva Vault Connector 1.3 - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::veevavault/veevavault-connector-studio.adoc


Anypoint Studio (Studio) editors help you design and update your Mule applications, properties, and configuration files.

To add and configure a connector in Studio:

. <<create-mule-project,Create a Mule project>>.
. <<add-connector-to-project,Add the connector to your Mule project>>.
. <<configure-source,Configure a source for the connector's flow>>.
. <<add-connector-operation,Add a connector operation to the flow>>.
. <<configure-global-element,Configure a global element for the connector>>.
. <<configure-other-fields,Configure the Other Connector Fields>>.

When you run the connector, you can view the app log to check for problems in real time, as described in <<view-app-log,View the App Log>>.


If you are new to configuring connectors in Studio, see xref:connectors::introduction/intro-config-use-studio.adoc[Use Studio to Configure a Connector]. If, after reading this topic, you need additional information about the connector fields, see the xref:veevault-connector-reference.adoc[Veeva Vault Connector Reference].

[[create-mule-project]]
== Create a Mule Project

In Studio, create a new Mule project in which to add and configure the connector: 

. In Studio, select *File > New > Mule Project*.
. Enter a name for your Mule project and click *Finish*.

[[add-connector-to-project]]
== Add the Connector to the Mule Project

Add Veeva Vault Connector to a Mule project to automatically populate the XML code with the connector's namespace and schema location, as well as add the required dependencies to the project's `pom.xml` file.

. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, type `veeva` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, click *Veeva Vault Connector - Mule 4*. 
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

Adding a connector to a Mule project in Studio does not make that same connector available to other projects in your Studio workspace.

[[configure-source]]
== Configure a Source for the Flow

A source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met.
You can configure one of these sources to use with Veeva Vault Connector:

* HTTP Listener 
+
Initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port
+
* Scheduler 
+
Initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met

For example, to configure an HTTP Listener source, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *HTTP > Listener*.
. Drag *Listener* to the Studio canvas.
. On the *Listener* configuration screen, optionally change the value of the *Display Name* field.
. Specify a value for the *Path* field.
. Click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to configure a global element that can be used by all instances of the HTTP Listener source in the app.
. On the *General* tab, specify the connection information for the connector.
. On the *TLS* tab, optionally specify the TLS information for the connector.
. On the *Advanced* tab, optionally specify reconnection information, including a reconnection strategy.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.

[[add-connector-operation]]
== Add a Connector Operation to the Flow

When you add a connector operation to your flow, you are specifying an action for that connector to perform.

To add an operation for Veeva Vault Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *Mule Palette* view, select *Veeva Vault* and then select the desired operation.
. Drag the operation onto the Studio canvas to the right of the source.

[[configure-global-element]]
== Configure a Global Element for the Connector

When you configure a connector, configure a global element that all instances of that connector in the app can use. Configuring a global element requires you to provide the authentication credentials that the connector requires to access the target Veeva Vault system. Veeva Vault supports basic authentication.

To configure the global element for Veeva Vault Connector, follow these steps:

. Select the operation in the Studio canvas.
. In the configuration screen for the operation, click the plus sign (*+*) next to the *Connector configuration* field to access the global element configuration fields.
. On the *General* tab, in *Connection*, enter the following configuration values:
+
image::veevavault-connector-basic-authentication-general.png[]
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Name* |Name for this configuration to reference it later.
|*Vault URL* |Veeva Vault instance URL.
|*Username* |Username for the Veeva Vault instance.
|*Password* |Password that corresponds to the username.
|*Version* |Veeva Vault instance version.
|*Client Id* |Client ID to send with each request in the header for tracking purposes, in the format: `\{organisation}-{company\|team}`. +
The client ID is prefixed with `mulesoft` and has a suffix with `client-vaultconnector` internally, for example: `mulesoft-abcpharma-clinicalprod-client-vaultconnector`.
|===
+
In the previous image, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the folder (`src/main/resources`) of your project. Although you can hardcode your credentials into the global configuration properties, you can simplify maintenance and achieve better project reusability if you reference a configuration file that contains these values instead. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments in which your access credentials differ (such as production, development, and QA). +
The following example is a snippet of the `configuration.yaml` file under the `src/main/resources/config` folder:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
	#Veeva Vault details
	veeva:
		vaultURL: "https://xxxx-xxxx.veevavault.com"
		username: "someone@example.com"
		password: "xxxxxxx"
		version : "v20.1"
		clientId: "mulesoft-abcpharma-clinicalprod-client-vaultconnector"
----
+
The connection configuration performs basic authentication, which accepts the required Vault URL, username, and password parameters to connect to the Veeva Vault instance to retrieve the session. The retrieved session is used for sending requests by each operation configured in the Mule application.
+
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that Mule can connect with the specified server.
. Click *OK*.


[[configure-other-fields]]
== Configure Additional Connector Fields

After you configure a global element for <connector name>, configure the other required fields for the connector.The required fields vary depending on which connector operation you use.

. In the *Veeva Vault Config* window, in the *Advanced* tab, configure the burst API limit:
+
image::veevavault-connector-basic-authentication-advanced.png[]
+
*Burst API Limit Profile*
+
The burst API limit profile configuration to act upon if the specified burst API limit of the Veeva Vault API reaches the threshold of the configured value or is exceeded.
+
If *Burst API limit config* is enabled (default), then the connector evaluates the Veeva Vault API's response header (`X-VaultAPI-BurstLimitRemaining`) value against the specified API Limit threshold value. If the remaining burst API limit reaches or exceeds this threshold value, the connector waits for the specified amount of time to restart the count for the *Burst Limit Remaining*.
+
Following is an example from the application logs, showing a warning message at `2019-06-06 10:34:45,096` and subsequently waiting for five minutes before rerunning as shown in the next message at `2019-06-06 10:39:45,098`:

If the *Daily API Limit Exceed Profile* is enabled (default), then the connector evaluates the Veeva Vault API's response header (*X-VaultAPI-DailyLimitRemaining*) for the specified value of the threshold, and throws an exception indicating that the daily API limit is exceeded. The exception continues to be thrown for each job or request created until the daily limit is reset or rolled over the next day.

[[view-app-log]]
== View the App Log

To check for problems, you can view the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file (`log4j2.xml`), you can also view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

== Next Step

After configuring Veeva Vault Connector for use in Studio, see the xref:veevavault-connector-config-topics.adoc[Additional Configuration Information] topic for more configuration steps.
