= Configure Web Service Security - Mule 4

The Web Service Security (WS-Security) protocol enables you to use various security token formats to enforce message integrity and confidentiality. This protocol uses XML Signature and XML Encryption to provide end-to-end security. To configure WS-Security in Anypoint Connector for Web Service Consumer (Web Service Consumer Connector) both in Anypoint Studio and XML editors, review the following guidelines.

WS-Security describes how to:

* Sign SOAP messages to ensure integrity and provide nonrepudiation
* Encrypt SOAP messages to ensure confidentiality
* Attach security tokens to ascertain the sender's identity

Web Service Consumer Connector supports the following strategies:

* Sign security
* Verify signature security
* Username token security
* Encrypt or decrypt security
* Incoming or outgoing timestamp security

== Configure WS-Security

The following example illustrates how you might configure a username token security strategy as WS-Security for the connector:

. In Studio, open the *Global Element Properties* window of the Web Service Consumer Connector.
. On the *Security* tab, for *Username token security strategy*, select `Edit inline`.
. Complete the *Username*, and *Password* fields, and set *Add nonce* and *Add created* fields to `true`.
. Click *OK*.

In Studio, configuring Username token security strategy as WS-Security looks like this:

.Configure WS-Security

In the *Configuration XML* tab, configuring Username token security strategy as WS-Security looks like this:
