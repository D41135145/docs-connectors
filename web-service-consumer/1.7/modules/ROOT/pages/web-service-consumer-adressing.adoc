= Configure Web Services Addressing - Mule 4

Web Services Addressing (WS-Addressing) provides transport-neutral mechanisms to address web services and messages. To configure WS-Addressing in Anypoint Connector for Web Service Consumer (Web Service Consumer Connector) both in Anypoint Studio and XML editors, review the following guidelines.

* WS-Addressing adds only metadata to the SOAP message as headers
* Because Web Service Consumer Connector supports only Web Service Reliable Messaging (WS-ReliableMessaging) with synchronous calls, `ReplyTo` and `FaultTo` parameters can not be used with WS-Addressing

== Configure WS-Addressing in the Connector Global Element

The following example illustrates shows how to configure WS-Addressing in the Web Service Consumer Connector Global Element properties:

. In Studio, open the *Global Element Properties* window of the Web Service Consumer Connector.
. On the *Addressing* tab, select the addressing version to use from the *Version* dropdown menu. Default version is `WSA2000508 (Default)`.
. In the *From* field, define a source endpoint address.
. Click *OK*.

The following screenshot shows the WS-Addressing configuration in Studio:
.Configure WS-Addressing Global Element

In the XML editor, the WS-Addressing configuration `<wsc:wsa>` is located under the Web Service Consumer Connector configuration `<wsc:config>`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wsc:config name="WSA_Config">
	<wsc:connection wsdlLocation="http://www.host.com?WSDL" service="Service" port="Port" />
	<wsc:wsa wsaVersion="WSA200508" wsaFrom="http://localhost:8080/from"/>
</wsc:config>
----

== Configure WS-Addressing for the Consume Operation

You can configure WS-Addressing on top of the Web Service Consumer Connector *Consume* operation, which affects the generated SOAP request by adding some specific SOAP headers.

The following example illustrates shows how to configure WS-Addressing for the *Consume* operation:

. In the Studio canvas, select the *Consume* operation.
. In the *Consume* operation properties view, select the *Advanced* tab.
. In the *Addressing* section, define the following parameters: +

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Parameter |Description | Required
|*Version* | The addressing version to use. If not defined, the parameter inherits the value defined at the | global configuration settings, otherwise overwrites the global settings value. |
|*From* | The source endpoint address. |
|*MessageID* | The message identifier. |
|*To* | The destination endpoint address. The value for this parameter is mandatory to use WS-Addressing | x
|*Action* | The semantic action associated with the web service operation. The value for this parameter is mandatory to use WS-Addressing | x
|*RelatesTo* | The message id to which the message relates. |
|===

The following screenshot shows the WS-Addressing for the *Consume* operation:
.Configure WS-Addressing Consume Operation

In the XML editor, the WS-Addressing configuration `<wsc:addressing>` is included under the Web Service Consumer Connector *Consumer* operation `<wsc:consume>`:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<wsc:consume operation="sayHi" config-ref="WSA_Config" >
        <wsc:message>
		<wsc:body>#[payload]</wsc:body>
	</wsc:message>
	<wsc:addressing wsaAction="http://localhost/action" wsaTo="http://localhost/to" wsaMessageID="#['MessageIDCustom']" wsaVersion="WSA200408" wsaFrom="http://localhost/from" wsaRelatesTo="RelatesToMessageId"/>
</wsc:consume>
