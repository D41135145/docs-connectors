= Commerce Cloud B2C Data Connector Studio Configuration - Mule 4

Before you can use a connector in Anypoint Studio, you must: 

. Install the connector by using either Anypoint Exchange or Anypoint Studio.
. Configure the connector.
. Configure an input source for the connector.

== Install the Connector Using Exchange
. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange (X) icon in the upper left of the Studio taskbar.
. In Exchange, click Login and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for Shop API Connector.
. Select Shop API Connector and click Add to project.
. Follow the prompts to install Shop API Connector.

== Install the Connector in Studio
. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule palette, click (X) Search in Exchange.
. In Add Modules to Project, type Shop API Connector in the search field.
. Click Shop API Connector in *Available modules*.
. Click Add.
. Click Finish.

== Add the Connector as a Mule App Dependency.

. Open your Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add the connector as a dependency in the pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mulesoft.connectors</groupId>
    <artifactId>shop-api</artifactId>
    <version>RELEASE</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
```

When Studio is updated, a message displays in the lower-right corner. Click the message to install the
update, and then update the Apache Maven pom.xml file dependencies to use the new version number.

== Configure the Connector
Shop API Connector supports three types of connection providers:

. Client Id Connection Provider
. Customers Auth Connection Provider
. Oauth2 Application Connection Provider

=== To Configure the Connector Using Client Id Connection Provider
. After adding a connector dependency to the Mule project, click the Global Elements tab at the base of the canvas.

. In the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click Create.

. In the Choose Global Type wizard, collapse the connector configuration, select Client Id Connection Provider, and click OK:

. You can either enter credentials directly into the global configuration properties or reference them from a configuration file that contains the values.
. This example adds credentials to the application properties file and references it using placeholders.
. Make a Test Connection... to validate the configuration.

```xml
   <shop:config name="Client_Id" doc:name="Shop Connector Config">
       <shop:client-id-connection baseUri="${shop.address}" xDwClientId="${shop.clientId}" />
   </shop:config>
```
